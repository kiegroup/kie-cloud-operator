# Kie Cloud Operator
ignore me
[![Go Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kiegroup/kie-cloud-operator)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kiegroup/kie-cloud-operator)

## Requirements

- go v1.17.x
- operator-sdk v0.19.2
- docker 
- [opm](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/releases)
- [podman](https://podman.io/)
- [cekit](https://cekit.io/)

## Build

```bash
make
```

The default builder is set to `podman`, to change set the *BUILDER* environment variable, e.g.:

```bash
BUILDER=docker make
```

## Upload to a container registry

e.g.
```bash
docker tag quay.io/kiegroup/kie-cloud-operator:<version> quay.io/<your-registry-username>/kie-cloud-operator:<version>
docker push quay.io/<your-registry-username>/kie-cloud-operator:<version>
```

### Note

If the quay.io repository where the images were pushed is private, a pull secret will need to be configured, 
otherwise all operator related images must be public.



## Deploy to OpenShift 4.7+ using OLM

To install this operator on OpenShift 4 for end-to-end testing, make sure you have access to a quay.io (https://quay.io/) account to create
an application repository. Follow the [authentication](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-courier/#authentication)
instructions for Operator Courier to obtain an account token.
This token is in the form of "basic <token>" and both words are required for the command.

Also note that the push command does not overwrite an existing repository,
and it needs to be deleted before a new version can be built and uploaded.
Once the bundle has been uploaded, create an [Operator Source](https://github.com/k8s-operatorhub/community-operators/)
to load your operator bundle in OpenShift.


**To create the bundle image follow the steps**

- Create your own bundle
- Push the bundle on the container registry
- Build the index
- Push the index on the container registry
- Disable default catalog sources on Openshift
- Write your Catalog-source
- Create your catalog source on Openshift
- Write your Subscription
- Create your Subscription on Openshift

**To Restore your cluster from your bundle image changes follow the steps**

- Cleanup your catalog-source

### Create your own Bundle

i.e. 7.13.0-1 version
Remove the following line from deploy/olm-catalog/dev/7.13.0-1/manifest/bamoe-businessautomation-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml

```console
replaces: bamoe-businessautomation-operator.<last-version>
```
Set your registry id, like quay username 
with USERNAME as env

```bash
export USERNAME=<your-registry-id>
```

activate Cekit and run the following command


```bash
$ make bundle-dev
```

the last log line is something like this:
```console
INFO  Image built and available under following tags: quay.io/<your_quay_username>/rhpam-operator-bundle:7.12.1, quay.io/${USERNAME}/rhpam-operator-bundle:latest
```
###  Push the bundle on the container registry

VERSION=$(go run getversion.go)

```bash
$ docker push quay.io/${USERNAME}/rhpam-operator-bundle:${VERSION}
```

### Build the index image

```bash
opm index add --bundles quay.io/${USERNAME}/rhpam-operator-bundle:${VERSION} --tag quay.io/${USERNAME}/rhpam-operator-index:${VERSION}
```
### Push the index on the container registry

Log in into your quay.io account:
```bash
podman login quay.io
```

Push the index on your quay repository
```bash
podman push quay.io/${USERNAME}/rhpam-operator-index:${VERSION}
```

#### Disable default catalog sources on Openshift

To test your Operator, with bundle and index you need to disable the default source like the operator hub
```bash
oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
```

#### Write your Catalog-source

A catalog source is repository of CSVs, CRDs, and packages that define an application.

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: xxxxxname
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: xxxxximage
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: grpc
```

Choose a CATALOG_SOURCE_NAME something like "my-operator-manifests"

Example of catalog-source.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-manifests
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/<your_quay_id>/rhpam-operator-index:7.13.0
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: grpc
```

#### Create catalog source on Openshift

```bash
oc create -f catalog-source.yaml
```

#### Write your Subscription

A subscription keeps CSVs up to date by tracking a channel in a package.

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: bamoe-businessautomation-operator
  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: bamoe-businessautomation-operator
  source: $CATALOG_SOURCE_NAME
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

Example of subscription.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: bamoe-businessautomation-operator
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: bamoe-businessautomation-operator
  source: my-operator-manifests
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

#### Create your Subscription on Openshift

You could create the subscription copying the yaml in the the OCP UI or from cli with Openshift Client

```bash
oc create -f subscription.yaml
```
On OpenShift go to your project (e.g. my-namespace) to see your subscription and your operator,
this could take a variable time to be visible.


#### Cleanup catalog-source

After your test are completed, to restore the Operator hub and remove your catalog source
delete your catalog source
and run the following command:

```bash
oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": false}]'
```

It will take a few minutes for the operator to become visible under the _OperatorHub_ section of the OpenShift console _Catalog_.
It can be easily found by filtering the provider type to _Custom_.

### Trigger a KieApp deployment

Use the OLM console to subscribe to the `Kie Cloud` Operator Catalog Source within your namespace. Once subscribed,
use the console to `Create KieApp` or create one manually as seen below.

```bash
$ oc create -f deploy/crs/v2/kieapp_rhpam_trial.yaml
kieapp.app.kiegroup.org/rhpam-trial created
```

### Clean up a KieApp deployment

```bash
oc delete kieapp rhpam-trial
```

## Development

Change log level at runtime w/ the `DEBUG` environment variable. e.g. -

```bash
make mod
make clean
DEBUG="true" operator-sdk run local --watch-namespace <namespace>
```

Also at runtime, change registry for rhpam ImageStreamTags -

```bash
INSECURE=true REGISTRY=<registry url> operator-sdk run local --watch-namespace<namespace>
```

Before submitting PR, please be sure to generate, vet, format, and test your code. This all can be done with one command.

```bash
make test
```

## Build rhel-based image for release

Requires `cekit` v3.11 and `rhpkg` -

```bash
# local build
make rhel
# scratch build
make rhel-scratch
# release candidate
make rhel-release
```

CSV Generation

```bash
make csv
```
