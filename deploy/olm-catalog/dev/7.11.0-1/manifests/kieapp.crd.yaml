                                    example, if the object reference is to a container
                                    within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to

                                  in JAVA_OPTS. This is used to calculate the maximum
                                  value of the initial heap memory. If used in a container
                                  without any memory constraints for the container
                                  then this option has no effect. If there is a memory
                                  constraint then '-Xms' is limited to the value set
                                  here. The default is 4096Mb which means the calculated
                                  value of '-Xms' never will be greater than 4096Mb.
                                  The value of this variable is expressed in MB. e.g.
                                  '4096'

                                  in JAVA_OPTS. This is used to calculate a default
                                  maximal heap memory based on a containers restriction.
                                  If used in a container without any memory constraints
                                  for the container then this option has no effect.
                                  If there is a memory constraint then '-Xmx' is set
                                  to a ratio of the container available memory as
                                  set here. The default is '50' which means 50% of
                                  the available memory is used as an upper boundary.
                                  You can skip this mechanism by setting this value
                                  to '0' in which case no '-Xmx' option is added.
